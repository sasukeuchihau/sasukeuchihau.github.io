			Here is so much I want to say, but don't. I understand why you don't have the capacity to deal with a relationship right now. But there are some things which can never be left unsaid, and here I am pouring out my heart to you hoping you'll read it someday. I know we're in the pursuit of achieving something amazing and big in life, something that'll leave a mark even after we die. But in the process, we have lost each other and that is something I've always been scared of. Your career will follow you through and you'll be a star at what you do.
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>Sometimes you just know when you've met your soulmate. You are my soulmate in every sense. I may have different personality types, and be completely opposite, but we're the same at heart. When I'm with you, it feels like the everything fits. The world doesn't suck, time goes by super fast and we have the best time together. I wouldn't and I cannot give that up for anything in this world. I know it's hard for you to respond to so much love, but I know I will always be the one who will love more in the relationship and I'm OK with that, as long as I have you tell me every night that you love me back.</em>
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>I want to thank you for making me the person I thought I couldn't be. You literally introduced me to me, and I'll always cherish that. I'm sorry I couldn't be as inspiring for you. I tried to keep you going when you were down and confused in life, and I'm sorry I couldn't. But I promise to always be there for you. That sucks for me, but I'll take it anyway.</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm a goofball full of love, fluff and unicorns. You're my 11:11 and always will be. Your life problems will go away, but my love never will. You're my best friend and the love of my life. I can't and won't feel that way about anyone else. Please don't take this away from me.

			It’s funny how someone can seem normal to you one day only for you to realize the next day that you are in love with them.
			Just thinking about you brings a smile to face, a twinkle to my eye, and a skipped beat to my heart. It is like a light bulb suddenly being turned on.
		</p>
		<p>
			Perhaps you're wondering why I'm doing this. I'm afraid I can't provide you an exact response to your question. Because you made me feel like I belonged again after such a long time. That is something for which I will be eternally grateful. I've gathered a small amount of information about my favorite things. Keep this as a token of my gratitude. Making this website and the pencil drawings was a lot of fun for me. By the way, the original photos can be downloaded using the following link. Send me a message if you want me to remove this.
